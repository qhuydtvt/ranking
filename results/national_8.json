The school also has a humanities division with eight majors. Undergraduate students are encouraged to get involved in research projects and develop new technologies through the school's Technogenesis philosophy. Students can opt for a cooperative education track, which is a five-year program with mostly alternating semesters of class and full-time, paid work. Students complete a full first and fifth year at Stevens, and pay for only four years of school. On campus, in Hoboken, N.J., there are more than 100 clubs and organizations, including about 15 fraternities and sororities. Housing is guaranteed for four years, and more than 60 percent of students choose to live on campus. The campus lies along the Hudson River, and New York City is a boat or subway ride away.</p><p>The Stevens Ducks mainly compete in the NCAA Division III Empire 8 Athletic Conference, and, through the school\u2019s Adopt-a-Team program, all student athletes have a faculty mentor to help them juggle sports and school work. Incoming freshmen are required to have the proper technology, and can use special school discounts to buy a laptop that can work with the software specialized to his or her major. The school was exclusively for male students until 1971, and now, females make up 30 percent of the student body.</p><p>Stevens also has a campus in Washington, D.C., where graduate students interested in working in the government sector can study systems engineering, maritime security and more. Notable Stevens alumni include Alfred W.

A public engineering and applied sciences school in Golden, Colorado, Mines has 14 academic departments, including Mechanical Engineering and Geophysics. The school also offers courses in the Liberal Arts &amp; International Studies and Economics &amp; Business departments. When students aren\u2019t studying, the school\u2019s location is ideal for outdoor recreation. Golden is 13 miles from the state capital of Denver and lies in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where students can bike, hike and climb. The campus also has a climbing wall for students to test their skills before attempting the Rockies. Cold-weather sports fans can partake in the annual Winter Carnival, a student-run affair packed with skiing and snowboarding at a local resort. The Mines sports teams, known as the Orediggers, compete in the NCAA Division II Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which is mostly made up of other teams from Colorado. The school mascot is Blaster the burro, and a giant \"M\" emblazoned onto nearby Mount Zion signifies the school spirit. There are more than 140 student clubs and organizations, including seven fraternities and three sororities. First-year students are required to live on campus. Even the student newspaper, The Oredigger, is decidedly science based; sections include weekly roundups of new discoveries and a Geek of the Week feature.</p><p>Research opportunities abound for undergraduate and graduate students at the Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and the Unconventional Natural Gas and Oil Institute, two on-campus powerhouses for energy innovation. The school campus is also home to a geology museum, where admission is free and students can check out displays from moon rocks to fossilized dinosaur tracks. Mines alumni garner some of the highest-paid starting salaries in the country, and graduates have gone on to excel as engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs. Notable alumni include Andrew Swiger, senior vice president and principal financial officer of ExxonMobil, and Harold M. Korell, executive chairman of the board of Southwestern Energy.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-universities", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayRank": "#75", "displayScore": "56", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 75, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}}, {"primaryKey": ["national-universities", "overall", "2221"], "institution": {"nonResponder": false, "nonResponderText": null, "primaryPhotoCard": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_25790_200x150mm.jpg", "primaryPhotoThumb": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_25790_170x170mm.jpg", "isPublic": true, "primaryKey": "2221", "schoolType": "national-universities", "ranking": "overall", "rankingType": "national-universities", "displayName": "University of Massachusetts--Amherst", "sortName": "universityofmassachusettsamherst", "urlName": "umass-amherst", "aliasNames": "UMass Amherst University of Massachusetts Amherst", "state": "MA", "city": "Amherst", "zip": "01003", "region": null, "xwalkId": "166629", "institutionalControl": "public", "rankingDisplayName": "National Universities", "rankingDisplayRank": "#75", "rankingDisplayScore": "56", "rankingMaxPossibleScore": null, "rankingSortRank": 75, "rankingNoteText": null, "rankingNoteCharacter": null, "rankingRankStatus": "ranked", "rankingIsTied": true}, "overall": {"displayName": "National Universities"}, "parent": {"displayName": "National Universities", "displayRank": "#75", "displayScore": "56", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 75, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}, "searchData": {"act-avg": {"rawValue": 25, "dataQaId": "act_score_25", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "actScoreSearch", "displayValue": "25-30", "noteCharacter": null}, "acceptance-rate": {"rawValue": 60, "dataQaId": "R_C_ACCEPT_RATE", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "rCAcceptRate", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "60%", "noteCharacter": null}, "businessRepScore": {"rawValue": 3.2, "dataQaId": "BUSINESS_PROGRAM", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "businessProgram", "fieldType": "numeric", "displayValue": "3.2", "noteCharacter": null}, "tuition": {"subText": null, "rawValue": 33662, "dataQaId": "v_search_tuition", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "searchTuition", "fieldType": "searchTuition", "displayValue": ["$33,662 (out-of-state)", "$15,596 (in-state)"], "noteCharacter": null}, "engineeringRepScore": {"rawValue": 2.9, "dataQaId": "ENGINEERING_PROGRAM", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "engineeringProgram", "fieldType": "numeric", "displayValue": "2.9", "noteCharacter": null}, "sat-avg": {"rawValue": 1130, "dataQaId": "sat_comp_25", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "satCompSearch", "displayValue": "1130-1330", "noteCharacter": null}, "cost-after-aid": {"rawValue": 35445.0, "dataQaId": "C_ALL_NET_COST", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "cAllNetCost", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "$35,445", "noteCharacter": null}, "parentRank": {"displayValue": null, "fieldName": "parentRank", "rawValue": null}, "enrollment": {"rawValue": 23373, "dataQaId": "TOTAL_UNDERGRADS", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "totalUndergrads", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "23,373", "noteCharacter": null}, "percent-receiving-aid": {"rawValue": 35, "dataQaId": "C_PCT_NEED_BASED_AID", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "cPctNeedBasedAid", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "35%", "noteCharacter": null}, "hs-gpa-avg": {"rawValue": 3.8, "dataQaId": "AVG_HS_GPA", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "avgHsGpa", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "3.8", "noteCharacter": null}}, "xwalkId": "166629", "blurb": "<p>Students at the University of Massachusetts\u2014Amherst can choose from about 90 majors or can design their own.

To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the \"M Book.\" Student couples who marry are known as \"Miami Mergers\" and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine's Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school.</p><p>To travel around campus and Oxford, students can use the Butler County Regional Transit Authority buses, free with student ID, and the door-to-door SafeRide shuttle service after dark.
