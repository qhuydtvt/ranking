It is also a cutting-edge research institution, receiving significant yearly federal funding, and hosting an annual undergraduate research symposium for students to present their work to the community. The university has a highly ranked<a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/items/04122\"> School of Medicine</a>, <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/items/02188\">College of Engineering</a> and <a href=\"http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/items/01240\">Michael G. Foster School of Business</a>. Known as a commuter school, the university does not require freshmen to live on campus, but it encourages students who do to conserve energy and recycle. Students can join one of the 800-plus student organizations on campus, including about 70 sororities and fraternities. Nearly three-fourths of UW graduates remain in the state post-graduation.</p><h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2><p><strong>How difficult is it to get accepted into the University of Washington?</strong></p><p>It can be difficult to gain admission to the UW\u2019s main campus in Seattle, which had a 45 percent acceptance rate in 2016, according to U.S. News data. Prospective students must apply though the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2016-09-16/high-schoolers-have-a-new-college-application-tool\">Coalition Application</a> and complete additional UW questions, according to the UW office of admissions website.</p><p><strong>Does the University of Washington have other campuses?</strong></p><p>Beyond UW\u2019s main campus in Seattle, the university has campuses in Bothell and Tacoma, Washington. The university was founded in Seattle in 1861, and the Bothell and Tacoma locations were established in 1990. All three UW campuses offer undergraduate and graduate degree programs.</p><p><strong>What is the University of Washington Honors Program?</strong></p><p>The UW Honors Program gives undergraduate students a chance to attend smaller classes, pursue special projects and have more interaction with UW faculty members. Students can choose between the interdisciplinary and departmental honors tracks. The first is more generally focused, and the latter provides an opportunity for in-depth study within a particular major. Extra-ambitious students can pursue both types of honors. Students can apply to the interdisciplinary honors program when they apply to UW or during the end of their freshman year. Students submit departmental honors applications after they choose their major.</p><p><strong>How does the University of Washington compare to other state schools?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Prospective students can see how UW compares to public universities nationwide by exploring the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public\">Top Public National Universities</a> ranking.
