Together, the schools make up the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts. All Clark students can get a WOO card: a pass that grants discounts at area attractions, baseball games and the local ski slope, Wachusett Mountain. Clark students can also ride the free intercampus shuttle to <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/worcester-ma/becker-college-2123/@@Academics_overview.html\">Becker College</a>, <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/worcester-ma/wpi-2233/@@Academics_overview.html\">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/worcester-ma/assumption-college-2118/@@Academics_overview.html\">Assumption College</a>, <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/worcester-ma/worcester-state-2190/@@Academics_overview.html\">Worcester State University</a> and <a href=\"http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/worcester-ma/holy-cross-2141\">College of the Holy Cross</a>. Students can also hop aboard to get to Worcester Public Library, Worcester Art Museum and the local train and bus station. On campus, Clark students can choose from around 130 clubs and organizations, but the school does not have a Greek system. The Clark Cougars sports teams compete in the NCAA Division III New England Women\u2019s and Men\u2019s Athletic Conference. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, and all students are allowed to bring cars. For road trips, Boston is less than an hour\u2019s drive away; New York City is a three-hour trip. Students can explore more than 50 study abroad options after declaring a major, and about one-third of Clark students participate.</p><p>Research is a particular focus for students at Clark University. Undergraduates are encouraged to get involved, and students showcase their work each semester during Fall Fest and Academic Spree Day. The school's research expertise is a century-long tradition; on campus in 1909, Sigmund Freud gave his famous Clark Lectures about psychoanalysis, and university researchers have been responsible for discoveries that led to the birth control pill and the formula for the wind-chill factor.

Kresge College, for example, is home to an organic garden where students can take classes; students who are members of the College Nine community are often active in volunteer efforts and the college's Alternative Spring Break trips. Students who own RVs can also choose to reside in Camper Park, a unique community of students who live in their own home-like vehicles and share a common bathroom and lounge. Student campers may live with pre-approved roommates who are full-time UCSC students or spouses. Students living in residence halls may only have overnight guests 15 times a school year, for a maximum of three nights each visit.</p><p>On campus, there are more than 25 miles of hiking and jogging trails, and more than 150 student clubs and organizations. Only about 1 percent of students are members of the school's small Greek system. The UC Santa Cruz sports teams are independent competitors in the NCAA's Division III. Athletes are cheered on by the Banana Slug, a nontraditional, yellow earthen creature that has been recognized among the best mascots in the country. For fun, students can tour Dead Central, a room full of Grateful Dead memorabilia donated by the band to UCSC, or explore the small beach town of Santa Cruz, located on Monterey Bay. There are rides and games on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and opportunities for swimming, sailing and kayaking on the bay. To get around, students can travel on the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District buses for free with school ID. For longer road trips, Monterey is 45 miles away, and San Francisco is a 75-mile trip.</p><p>In particular, this public research institution\u2019s academic prowess looks to the skies. The school is nationally known for astronomy and space sciences programs. Other creative programs include a computer game design major, and UCSC was the first school in the University of California system to offer the degree. Female engineers are in especially good company at UCSC; the school is noted for offering one of the highest percentages of engineering graduate degrees to women. Notable alumni include Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dana Priest, NPR broadcast producers Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson, known as The Kitchen Sisters, and romance novelist Jayne Ann Krentz, who often writes under the pseudonyms Amanda Quick and Jayne Castle.</p>", "ranking": {"ranking": "overall", "type": "national-universities", "displayName": "National Universities", "displayRank": "#81", "displayScore": "54", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 81, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}}, {"primaryKey": ["national-universities", "overall", "1431"], "institution": {"nonResponder": false, "nonResponderText": null, "primaryPhotoCard": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_4016_200x150mm.jpg", "primaryPhotoThumb": "https://www.usnews.com/img/college-photo_4016_170x170mm.jpg", "isPublic": true, "primaryKey": "1431", "schoolType": "national-universities", "ranking": "overall", "rankingType": "national-universities", "displayName": "University of Delaware", "sortName": "universityofdelaware", "urlName": "university-of-delaware", "aliasNames": null, "state": "DE", "city": "Newark", "zip": "19716", "region": null, "xwalkId": "130943", "institutionalControl": "public", "rankingDisplayName": "National Universities", "rankingDisplayRank": "#81", "rankingDisplayScore": "54", "rankingMaxPossibleScore": null, "rankingSortRank": 81, "rankingNoteText": null, "rankingNoteCharacter": null, "rankingRankStatus": "ranked", "rankingIsTied": true}, "overall": {"displayName": "National Universities"}, "parent": {"displayName": "National Universities", "displayRank": "#81", "displayScore": "54", "maxPossibleScore": null, "sortRank": 81, "noteText": null, "noteCharacter": null, "rankStatus": "ranked", "isTied": true}, "searchData": {"act-avg": {"rawValue": 23, "dataQaId": "act_score_25", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "actScoreSearch", "displayValue": "23-29", "noteCharacter": null}, "acceptance-rate": {"rawValue": 65, "dataQaId": "R_C_ACCEPT_RATE", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "rCAcceptRate", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "65%", "noteCharacter": null}, "businessRepScore": {"rawValue": 3.0, "dataQaId": "BUSINESS_PROGRAM", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "businessProgram", "fieldType": "numeric", "displayValue": "3.0", "noteCharacter": null}, "tuition": {"subText": null, "rawValue": 32250, "dataQaId": "v_search_tuition", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "searchTuition", "fieldType": "searchTuition", "displayValue": ["$32,250 (out-of-state)", "$12,830 (in-state)"], "noteCharacter": null}, "engineeringRepScore": {"rawValue": 3.0, "dataQaId": "ENGINEERING_PROGRAM", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "engineeringProgram", "fieldType": "numeric", "displayValue": "3.0", "noteCharacter": null}, "sat-avg": {"rawValue": 1090, "dataQaId": "sat_comp_25", "noteText": null, "fieldName": "satCompSearch", "displayValue": "1090-1300", "noteCharacter": null}, "cost-after-aid": {"rawValue": null, "dataQaId": "C_ALL_NET_COST", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "cAllNetCost", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "N/A", "noteCharacter": null}, "parentRank": {"displayValue": null, "fieldName": "parentRank", "rawValue": null}, "enrollment": {"rawValue": 18374, "dataQaId": "TOTAL_UNDERGRADS", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "totalUndergrads", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "18,374", "noteCharacter": null}, "percent-receiving-aid": {"rawValue": null, "dataQaId": "C_PCT_NEED_BASED_AID", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "cPctNeedBasedAid", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "N/A", "noteCharacter": null}, "hs-gpa-avg": {"rawValue": 3.7, "dataQaId": "AVG_HS_GPA", "anchorPage": null, "anchorLocation": null, "noteText": null, "fieldName": "avgHsGpa", "fieldType": null, "displayValue": "3.7", "noteCharacter": null}}, "xwalkId": "130943", "blurb": "<p>For students interested in attending the University of Delaware, it pays to live in the state.
